# libvibe
An in-development library that is used in the [Vibe] Music Player and also by the plugins made for it.

Usage documentation is planned for this library; currently there's only JSDoc mostly everywhere in the code, which you can use to learn how to do stuff.

You can also take a look at the [Vibe Wiki] for [developing plugins].

> [!warning]
> Since this is still in-development, things are unstable and subject to change.
